## About

A very basic SQLite implementation for learning purposes. What I learned while doing this exercise

- How does DB store the data internally 
- DB Pages structure
- Low-level handling/parsing of data.
- B trees
- Indexes
- Varints, Records
- DB header, Page Headers
- Optimisation using indexes
